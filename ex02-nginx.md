Create a new directory called `ex02`. And create an `index.html` file in it.

```terminal
$ mkdir ex02
$ echo hello world > ex02/index.html
```

*You're on your own now ...*

Figure out how to use nginx to serve the contents of the `ex02` directory and view it in your browser on your machine.  

(Hint: read the documentation for the [nginx image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).)
